# Browser Extensions Manager UI
![Preview of webpage](./Preview.png)

## Description
This is my version of Frontend Mentor's browser extensions manager UI challenge. This is a simple UI that allows you to enable, disable, and remove browser extensions. It's fully responsive and uses a JSON file to load the extensions. I've also added my own QOL features like a warning dialog when removing extensions and a count of active and inactive extensions.

## Features Included From Original
- Dark Mode / Light Mode
- Tabs
- Panels
- Removing Extensions
- Toggle to enable/disable extensions
- Loading available extensions from a JSON file

## Features Added
- Warning Dialoge when removing extensions
- Count of active, inactive, and total extensions
